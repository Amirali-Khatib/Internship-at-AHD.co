# Internship-at-AHD.co
AHD.co has been established since 2019 which mainly focuses on developing products based on Natural Language processing  methods.
Here are the main projects that I completed during my internship period.
* **Data retrieval** through **web crawling** using **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** libraries. (Case study: Gathering Iranian celebrities from **www.Manzoom.ir** website)
* Reading Large text datasets (13GB.) in **Google Colab** and do some EDA one the text-based data.
* **Topic modeling** of **Religious question-answering dataset** with **clustering**. (I used **Word2Vec**, **Bag of words**, and **TF-IDF** methods for converting **character-based** form to **numerical representation**)
* Developing Linear vector quantization (**LVQ**) classification algorithm to classify **MNIST handwritten digit dataset**
* Developing Self-Organized Map (**SOM**) clustering algorithm for segmentation of **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** and evaluating them with classification metrics (accuracy)!
